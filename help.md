Local Gallery is a local-only browser for folders of images and videos, with most controls mirrored so you can use it one-handed from either side of the keyboard. It loads a folder locally and never uploads files, but it can alter files by writing metadata (scores, tags, options) so use it cautiously. The root starts on the left and you navigate deeper by moving right and down; the directories pane lists the current folder's files, while the preview pane shows the selected item in more detail.

## Load a folder (writable)
- Click `Load Folder` to pick a root folder. The app will scan for images/videos and create a small `.local-gallery` folder to store scoring, tags, and preferences.
- Only media files are shown (images + videos). Filter modes can restrict what appears.

## Basic navigation keys (mirrored)
- Move selection: `↑/↓`, `W/S`, or `I/K`.
- Enter/leave folders: `→`/`Enter`/`D`/`L` to go in, `←`/`Backspace`/`A`/`J` to go out.
- Open Gallery Mode: `G`. Close preview/gallery: `Esc` (or `G` in Gallery Mode).
- Fast jumps: `1/6` -50, `2/7` -10, `3/8` previous folder's first file, `4/9` +10, `5/0` +50.
- Video controls: `Space` play/pause, `Q/E` seek back/forward, mirrored by `U/O`.
- Filters & behaviors: `F/H` cycle media filter, `R/Y` toggle random order, `C/N` cycle folder behavior.
- Slideshow: `Shift` toggles the slideshow speed set in Options.
- Jump to next folder's first file: `X` or `M`.
- Jump to previous folder's first file: `3` or `8`.

## Other hotkeys & controls
- Hold `/` to show the keyboard cheatsheet overlay (only while the key is held down).
- Use the `?` button in the title bar to open/close this help panel.

## BANIC! button
- Press `B` to trigger BANIC! (mutes Local Gallery, blacks out the screen, and can open a harmless site). Press `B` again to resume.

## Directories + preview panes
- Selecting a folder shows its contents; selecting a file shows a large in-pane preview.
- The breadcrumb at the top lets you jump to any parent folder.
- Press `Esc` while previewing a file to return to folder preview.

## Gallery Mode (fullscreen overlay)
- Open with `G`. Close with `G` or `Esc`.
- `↑/↓` moves between items (folders and files) in the current directory.
- `←/→` leaves/enters directories (folders act like navigable items).

## Searching
- Use the search bar to filter the current view by name (folders only).
- Search stays active until you click `X` in the search bar.

## Scoring (folder scoring)
- Scoring visibility is controlled from `Preferences` in the Options menu.
- Folder scores can show arrows, show score only, or hide everything.

## Tags (single-folder)
- Open the folder menu (⋯) on a folder row and choose `Tag` to edit its tags (comma-separated). Press `Enter` to save or `Esc` to cancel.
- When the current directory contains tagged child folders, tag chips appear (with counts). Click to include, click again to hide, click a third time to clear.

## Tags (multi-folder)
- Click `Select` to show folder checkboxes, then click folders to select multiple folders.
- Use the select menu (☰) to tag, favorite, or hide the selected folders. `Tag selected` opens the bulk tag row.
- In the bulk tag row, type comma-separated tags and/or click existing tag chips, then click `Apply`.
- Click `Clear` to reset the selection.

## Hidden folders
- Use the `Hidden` button to switch into hidden mode and view hidden folders.
- Hidden folders are only visible while hidden mode is active.
